# Welcome to Microsoft Build 2023 Workshops

## Improve developer productivity with GitHub 

.NET 7 version of Reading Time application (MVC web app and unit tests).

**Plan, build, and deploy a .NET 7 web app with GitHub Issues, GitHub Codespaces, and GitHub Copilot and deploy it to Microsoft Azure with GitHub Actions**

In this lab you are going to learn how to plan and track your work with [GitHub Issues and Projects](https://github.com/features/issues), how to start and use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to make some changes to an existing app with the help of [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), and how to use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to provision resources on the cloud and to build and deploy the web application to Microsoft Azure.
